## Regenerating the Video

To regenerate the video or create variations:

```bash
cd /home/runner/work/LLM4Hardware/LLM4Hardware
python generate_intro_video.py
```

## Customization

The `generate_intro_video.py` script can be modified to:
- Change slide content
- Adjust timing and duration
- Modify visual styling
- Add new research areas
- Update color schemes

The script uses:
- **MoviePy** for video composition
- **PIL (Pillow)** for image generation
- **OpenCV** for image processing
- **DejaVu fonts** for professional typography

## Integration

This video is designed to be used:
- As an introduction before detailed module presentations
- In academic conferences and workshops
- For repository documentation and README files
- As educational material for understanding LLM applications in hardware design

The video provides the perfect foundation for presenting the three main sub-modules of the LLM4Hardware research collection.
