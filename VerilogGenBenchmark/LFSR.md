I am trying to create a Verilog model for an LFSR. It must meet the following specifications:
	- Inputs:
		- Clock
        - Active-low reset
	- Outputs:
		- Data (8-bits)

The initial state should be 10001010, and the taps should be at locations 1, 4, 6, and 7.

How would I write a design that meets these specifications?
